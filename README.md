##what this project does?
This project is a food styling project in which people can style their food however they like and when  they are done it shows a picture of how their food looks.
##how we built it?
We are using html, css, javascript, jquery and bootstrap. The developer team is working on getting the interective part to work.
##Challenges we ran to
The challenges that we ran to were getting the interactive  part to work and collabarating in the same file of code was kind of diffcult because everyone was editing.
##What we laerned?
First thing we learned was how to spell avocado, another of the things we learned was getting a better understanding of bootsrap, adding audio files into html, how to link pictures and change the sizes. 
##whar is next for this project?
Further steps for this project would be adding more challenges also adding a clear button plus different foods from different countries.
